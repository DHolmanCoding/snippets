* Python variable assignment:
name = object

multiple assignments:
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
a, b = (1, 2)

a = b = c = 1 # All names point to the same object in memory

* Datatypes:
bool: is a subclass of int with only True and False instances
True < bool < int
False < bool < int

int: arbitrarily sized ints

float: C doubles

complex = 1 + 10j

str: by default, strings are unicode, but you can also do b'byte_strings' like this,
     and r'raw_string' like this (ignores all escape characters.

python differentiates between sequences (ordered) and collections (like set and dict)

n-tuple: ordered collection of n values of any type, immutable, hashable if elts are hashable

list: ordered collection of any type, mutable, not hashable

set: An unordered collection of unique values. elts must be hashable

dict: An unordered collection of unique key-value pairs. keys must be hashable

constants in the python namespace:
- True and False values of build-in bool
- None singleton
- NotImplemented

* Lists
.append(object)
.insert(index, object)  # shifts everything right
.remove(object)  # removes first instance of an object
.index(object)
.count(object)
.reverse or list[::-1]
.pop([index])  # if no argument is passed it removed the last object
               # this method returns the object that is being popped

* Tuples
If there is only one element they mut be defined as (object,) or tuple(object)

* Dictionaries
The json module is the python std library can be used to convert b/t json and dicts

* defaultdict (from collections import defaultdict)
never raises a KeyError, since it will default to the value passed on initialization
defaultdict(int)  # int defaults to initializing a key with value 0 and is useful for counting

You can take in user input with input()

* Built-in modules and functions
A module is a file containing python functions and definitions
dir() passed without args will pass all the functions in the current scope
help(function)
A module is created by making a .py file
If the module is inside a directory and needs to be detected by python, include an __init__

Python 2.7 installation on Linux:
wget --no-check-certificate https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.X/Python-2.7.X.tgz
tar -xzf Python-2.7.X.tgz
cd Python-2.7.X
./configure
make
sudo make install

Python install on OSX:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install python
brew install python3

checking your installs:
py -2
py -3
py -2 -m pip -V
py -3 -m pip -V

* String functions
Readable representations of objects can be obtained by:
    - repr(object) (for eval convertible string eval(repr(object)) is id(object))
    - str(object) (for human readable string)

* Installing external modules with pip
pip search [query]
pip install [package]
pip install [package]==0.0.0
pip install [package]>=0.0.0
pip list outdated
pip install -U pip
don't be afraid to use the help([module]) function in the python interpreter
