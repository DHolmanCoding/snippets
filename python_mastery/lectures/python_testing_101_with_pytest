What is testing?
A guarantee of desired functionality that makes your code more self-documenting

Why would I test:
- safety net for future changes
- prove that the code works as desired
- give examples to other of how to use code

Why not unittest from the std library?
you can use a magic overloaded assert

oh, and by the way, here is how to set up a venv:
python3 -m  venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
