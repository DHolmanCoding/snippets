If a file has a __name__ of 'main', it was not imported but ran directly

In order to log with the name of the file you are working in:
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Every distribution package requires a setup.py file which describes the packages

Standard template:
from setuptools import setup
setup(
    name='package_name', # package name
    version='0.1', # version
    description='Package Description', # short description
    url='http://example.com', # package URL
    install_requires=[], # list of packages this package depends
                         # on.
    packages=['package_name'], # List of module names that installing
                               # this package will provide.
)

Uploading a package to PyPI

# .pypirc file
[distutils]
index-servers =
 pypi
 pypitest

[pypi]
repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username=your_username
password=your_password

[pypitest]
repository=https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
username=your_username
password=your_password

# you can see the manual for more details on getting twine and doing the uplaod

If you want your package to be executable, you can add a __main file to the
package_name directory:
python -m package_name
