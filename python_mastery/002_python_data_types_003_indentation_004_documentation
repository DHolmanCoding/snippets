Data types are variables you use to reserve space in memory

frozenset() is an immutable version of a set()

numeric types: int, float, complex (3 + 2j) , and long (3000L)

* How indentation is parsed in python
Whitespace is handled by the lexical analyzer (lexer) before parsing.
The lexer does this using a stack, that begins with just the value 0.
An new indentation level is pushed to the stack when whitespace is encountered,
and an indent token is inserted into the token stream which is passed to the parser.

example:
if foo:
 if bar:
 x = 42
else:
 print foo

is analyzed as:
<if> <foo> <:> [0]
<INDENT> <if> <bar> <:> [0, 4]
<INDENT> <x> <=> <42> [0, 4, 8]
<DEDENT> <DEDENT> <else> <:> [0]
<INDENT> <print> <foo> [0, 2]
<DEDENT>

* Programmatically acessing docstrings
func(object.__doc__) will work for modules, functions and object with docstrings.

Sphinx is a tool used to generate HTML based documentation for python projects based on the docstrings.
But, the Google Python Style guide is more human readable: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
Using the Napolean plug-in Sphinx can parse the Google Style Guide format
