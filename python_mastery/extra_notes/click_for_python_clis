Out CLI application read from stdin and write to stdout so pipes will work!

Applicatons should exit with a meaningful status code (0=success, non-zero=failure)

@click.command()
@click.option()
def hello_world()
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':  # main is the entrypoint of the application.
    hello_world()           # So, if the module is being run directly this will execute.
