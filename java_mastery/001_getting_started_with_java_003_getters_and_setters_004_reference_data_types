# Hello world and welcome to Java
# The file containing this class must be HelloWorld
public class HelloWorld {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
     }
}

public - the method can be called from anywhere, even outside the program
static - can be run at the class level without making an object
void - returns no value

String[] args is a vector of command line arguments

# javac HelloWorld.java  # compiles to bytecode
# java HelloWorld        # runs a java application

Getters and Setters:
Setters and getters allow an object to contain private variables which can
be accessed or changed with restriction.

public class CountHolder {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized int getCount() { return count; }  # synchronized adds thread safety
    public synchronized void setCount(int c) { count = c; }

}

Reference Data Types:
Instantiating a reference type:
Object obj = new Object(); // Note the 'new' keyword
<reference type> <variable> = new <Constructor>

primitives just store value like conventional variables:
int i = 10;
